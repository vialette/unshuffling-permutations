There are a number of further directions of investigation in this
general subject. They cover several areas: algorithmic, combinatorics,
and algebra. Let us mention several -~not necessarily new~- open
problems that are, in our opinion, the most interesting. How many
permutations of $S_{2n}$ are squares? How many $(213,231)$-avoiding
permutations of $S_{2n}$ are squares? (Equivalently, by
Proposition~\ref{prop:bijection_binary_to_permutations_squares},
how many binary strings of length $2n$ are squares; Problem~4
in \cite{Henshall:Rampersad:Shallit:2011})? How hard is the problem of
deciding whether a $(213,231)$-avoiding permutation is a square
(Problem~4 in \cite{Henshall:Rampersad:Shallit:2011},
see also \cite{Buss:Soltys:2014,Rizzi:Vialette:CSR:2013})?
Given two permutations $\pi$ and~$\sigma$, how hard is the problem of
deciding whether $\sigma$ is a square root of~$\pi$?
Moreover, one can ask for a complete algebraic study of
$\QQ[S]$ as a graded associative algebra for the shuffle  product
$\SHUFFLE$. Describing a generating family for $\QQ[S]$, defining
multiplicative bases of $\QQ[S]$, and determining whether $\QQ[S]$ is
free as an associative algebra are worthwhile questions.
