We denote by $S_n$ the set of permutations of size $n$ and by $S$ the
set of all permutations. If $\pi$ is a permutation, we denote by $|\pi|$
its size. If $P$ is a subset of $[|\pi|]$, $\pi_{|P}$ is the subword of
$\pi$ consisting in the letters of $\pi$ at the positions specified by
the elements of $P$. Besides, we denote by $\widetilde{\pi}$ (resp.
$\bar \pi$, $\pi^{-1}$) the mirror image (resp. complementary, inverse)
of $\pi$. If $u$ is a word of integers without multiple occurrences of a
same letter, $\STD(u)$ denotes the unique permutation of same size as
$u$ such that for all $i, j \in [|u|]$, $u_i < u_j$ if and only if
$\STD(u)_i < \STD(u)_j$.

\section{Algebraic issues}
\label{section:Algebraic issues}
Let use denote by $\QQ[S]$ the linear span of all permutations. We shall
define on this space a kind of shuffle product. For this purpose, we
first define a linear coproduct $\Delta$ on $\QQ[S]$ satisfying for
any permutation $\pi$,
\begin{equation} \label{equ:unshuffling_coproduct}
    \Delta(\pi) =
    \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
    \STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right) \otimes \STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right).
\end{equation}
We call $\Delta$ the {\em unshuffling coproduct of permutations}. For
instance,
\begin{equation}
    \Delta(213) =
    \epsilon \otimes 213 + 2. 1 \otimes 12 +
    1 \otimes 21 + 2. 12 \otimes 1 + 21 \otimes 1 + 213 \otimes \epsilon,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Delta(1234) =
    \epsilon \otimes 1234 + 4. 1 \otimes 123 + 6. 12 \otimes 12 +
    4. 123 \otimes 1 + 1234 \otimes \epsilon,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\begin{split} \label{equ:example_unshuffling_coproduct}
    \Delta(1432) & =
    \epsilon \otimes 1432 + 3. 1 \otimes 132 + 1 \otimes 321 +
    3. 12 \otimes 21 \\ & + 3. 21 \otimes 12 + 3. 132 \otimes 1 +
    321 \otimes 1 + 1432 \otimes \epsilon.
\end{split}\end{equation}
Observe that the coefficient of the tensor $1 \otimes 132$ is $3$
in~\eqref{equ:example_unshuffling_coproduct} because there are exactly
three ways to extract two disjoint subwords of the permutation $1432$
so that the letters of these two subwords have the same relative order
as the letters of the permutations $1$ and $132$.
\medskip

As any coproduct, $\Delta$ leads to the definition of a product obtained
by duality in the following way. From~\eqref{equ:unshuffling_coproduct},
for any permutation $\pi$, we have
\begin{equation}
    \Delta(\pi) =
    \sum_{\sigma, \nu \in S} \lambda_{\sigma, \nu}^\pi \;
    \sigma \otimes \nu,
\end{equation}
where the $\lambda_{\sigma, \nu}^\pi$ are nonnegative integers. Now,
by definition of duality, the dual product of $\Delta$ denoted by
$\SHUFFLE$ is a linear binary product on $\QQ[S]$. It satisfies, for any
permutations
$\sigma$ and $\nu$,
\begin{equation}
    \sigma \SHUFFLE \nu =
    \sum_{\pi \in S}
    \lambda_{\sigma, \nu}^\pi \; \pi.
\end{equation}
We call $\SHUFFLE$ the {\em shuffle product of permutations}. For instance,
\begin{equation}\begin{split} \label{equ:example_shuffle_product}
    12 \SHUFFLE 21 & =
    1243 + 1324 + 2.1342 + 2.1423 + 3.1432 + 2134 + 2.2314 \\
    & + 3.2341 + 2413 + 2.2431 + 2.3124 + 3142 + 3.3214 + 2.3241 \\
    & + 3421 + 3.4123 + 2.4132 + 2.4213 + 4231 + 4312.
\end{split}\end{equation}
Observe that the coefficient $3$ of the permutation $1432$
in~\eqref{equ:example_shuffle_product} comes from the fact that the
coefficient of the tensor $12 \otimes 21$ is $3$
in~\eqref{equ:example_unshuffling_coproduct}.
\medskip

Intuitively, this product shuffles the values and the positions of the
letters of the permutations. There are other shuffle products on
permutations~\cite{DHT:IJAC:2002}: the {\em shifted shuffle} and the
{\em convolution product}. Our shuffle product is different from these
last two.
\medskip

We say that a permutation $\pi$ {\em appears} in the shuffle
$\sigma \SHUFFLE \nu$ of two permutations $\sigma$ and $\nu$ if the
coefficient $\lambda_{\sigma, \nu}^\pi$ is different from zero.
Besides, a permutation $\pi$ is a {\em square} if there is a permutation
$\sigma$ such that $\pi$ appears in $\sigma \SHUFFLE \sigma$. In this
case, we say that $\sigma$ is a {\em square root} of $\pi$. Equivalently,
$\pi$ is a square with $\sigma$ as square root if and only if in the
expansion of $\Delta(\pi)$, there is a tensor $\sigma \otimes \sigma$
with a nonzero coefficient.
\medskip

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:shuffle_associative_commutative}
    The shuffle product $\SHUFFLE$ of permutations is associative and
    commutative.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    To prove the associativity of $\SHUFFLE$, it is convenient to show
    that its dual coproduct $\Delta$ is coassociative, that is
    \begin{equation}
        (\Delta \otimes I) \Delta = (I \otimes \Delta) \Delta,
    \end{equation}
    where $I$ denote the identity map. This strategy relies on the fact
    that a product is associative if and only if its dual coproduct is
    coassociative. For any permutation $\pi$, we have
    \begin{equation} \begin{split}
    \label{equ:shuffle_associative_commutative}
        (\Delta \otimes I) \Delta(\pi) & =
        (\Delta \otimes I)
        \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right) \otimes \STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & =
        \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \Delta\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)\right)
        \otimes I\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)\right) \\
        & =
        \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \sum_{Q_1 \uplus Q_2 = [|P_1|]}
        \STD\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)_{|Q_1}\right)
        \otimes
        \STD\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)_{|Q_2}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & =
        \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 \uplus P_3 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right) \otimes
        \STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right) \otimes
        \STD\left(\pi_{|P_3}\right).
    \end{split} \end{equation}
    An analogous computation shows that $(I \otimes \Delta) \Delta(\pi)$
    is equal to the last member of~\eqref{equ:shuffle_associative_commutative},
    whence the associativity of $\SHUFFLE$.
    \smallskip

    Finally, to prove the commutativity of $\SHUFFLE$, we shall show
    that $\Delta$ is cocommutative, that is for any permutation $\pi$,
    if in the expansion of $\Delta(\pi)$ there is a tensor
    $\sigma \otimes \nu$ with a coefficient $\lambda$, there is in the
    same expansion the tensor $\nu \otimes \sigma$ with the same
    coefficient $\lambda$. Clearly, a product is associative if and only
    if its dual coproduct is coassociative. Now, from the
    definition~\eqref{equ:unshuffling_coproduct} of $\Delta$, one
    observes that if the pair $(P_1, P_2)$ of subsets of $[|\pi|]$
    contributes to the coefficient of
    $\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right) \otimes \STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)$,
    the pair $(P_2, P_1)$ contributes to the coefficient of
    $\STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right) \otimes \STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)$.
    This shows that $\Delta$ is cocommutative and hence, that $\SHUFFLE$
    is commutative.
\end{proof}
\medskip

Proposition~\ref{prop:shuffle_associative_commutative} implies that
$\QQ[S]$ endowed with the unshuffling coproduct $\Delta$ is a
coassociative cocommutative coalgebra, or in an equivalent way, that
$\QQ[S]$ endowed with the shuffle product $\SHUFFLE$ is an associative
commutative algebra.
\medskip

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:endomorphisms}
    The three linear maps
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3 : \QQ[S] \to \QQ[S]
    \end{equation}
    linearly sending a permutation $\pi$ to, respectively,
    $\widetilde{\pi}$, $\bar \pi$, and $\pi^{-1}$ are endomorphims of
    associative algebras.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    To prove that, for $j = 1, 2, 3$, $\phi_j$ is a morphism of
    associative algebras, we have to prove that for all permutations
    $\sigma$ and $\nu$,
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_j(\sigma \SHUFFLE \nu) =
        \phi_j(\sigma) \SHUFFLE \phi_j(\nu).
    \end{equation}
    We shall proceed here as we have done during the proof of
    Proposition~\ref{prop:shuffle_associative_commutative} by showing
    that $\phi_j$ is a morphism of coalgebras, that is
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta \phi_j = (\phi_j \otimes \phi_j) \Delta.
    \end{equation}
    In the sequel, $\pi$ is a permutation.
    \smallskip

    If $P$ is a set of indexes of letters of $\pi$, we denote by
    $\widetilde{\pi}$ the set $\{|\pi| - i  + 1 : i \in P\}$. Now since
    this operation $\widetilde{\,}$ define a bijection on the set of the
    subsets of $[|\pi|]$ and the standardisation operation commutes with
    the mirror operation on words, we have
    \begin{equation} \begin{split}
        \Delta(\phi_1(\pi))
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\phi_1(\pi)_{|P_1}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\phi_1(\pi)_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\widetilde{\pi}_{|P_1}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\widetilde{\pi}_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\widetilde{\pi}_{|\widetilde{P_1}}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\widetilde{\pi}_{|\widetilde{P_2}}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \widetilde{\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)}
        \otimes \widetilde{\STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)} \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \phi_1\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)\right)
        \otimes \phi_1\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)\right) \\
        & = (\phi_1 \otimes \phi_1) \Delta(\pi).
    \end{split} \end{equation}
    This shows that $\phi_1$ is a morphism of coalgebras and hence, that
    $\phi_1$ is a morphism of associative algebras.
    \smallskip

    Next, since by definition of the complementation operation on
    permutations, for any permutation $\tau$ and any indexes $i$ and $k$,
    we have $\tau_i < \tau_j$ if and only if $\bar \tau_i > \bar \tau_j$,
    we have
    \begin{equation} \begin{split}
        \Delta(\phi_2(\pi))
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\phi_2(\pi)_{|P_1}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\phi_2(\pi)_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\bar \pi_{|P_1}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\bar \pi_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \phi_2\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)\right)
        \otimes \phi_2\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)\right) \\
        & = (\phi_2 \otimes \phi_2) \Delta(\pi).
    \end{split} \end{equation}
    This shows that $\phi_2$ is a morphism of coalgebras and hence, that
    $\phi_2$ is a morphism of associative algebras.
    \smallskip

    Finally, for any permutation $\tau$, if $P$ is a set of indexes of
    letters of $\tau$, we denote by $P_\tau^{-1}$ the set
    $\{\tau_i : i \in P\}$. Since the map sending a subset $P$ of
    $[|\pi|]$ to $P_\pi^{-1}$ is a bijection and
    $\STD\left(\pi_{|P}\right)^{-1} = \STD\left(\pi^{-1}_{|P_\pi^{-1}}\right)$,
    we have
    \begin{equation} \begin{split}
        \Delta(\phi_3(\pi))
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\phi_3(\pi)_{|P_1}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\phi_3(\pi)_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\pi^{-1}_{|P_1}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\pi^{-1}_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\pi^{-1}_{|{P_1}_\pi^{-1}}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\pi^{-1}_{|{P_2}_\pi^{-1}}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)^{-1}
        \otimes \STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)^{-1} \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \phi_3\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)\right)
        \otimes \phi_3\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)\right) \\
        & = (\phi_3 \otimes \phi_3) \Delta(\pi).
    \end{split} \end{equation}
    This shows that $\phi_3$ is a morphism of coalgebras and hence, that
    $\phi_3$ is a morphism of associative algebras.
\end{proof}
\medskip

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:square_stability}
    Let $\pi$ be a square permutation and $\rho$ be a square root of
    $\pi$. Then,
    \begin{enumerate}[label={\it (\roman*)},fullwidth]
        \item \label{item:square_stability_1}
        the permutation $\widetilde{\pi}$ is a square and
        $\widetilde{\rho}$ is one of its square roots;
        \item \label{item:square_stability_2}
        the permutation $\bar \pi$ is a square and $\bar \rho$ is one of
        its square roots;
        \item \label{item:square_stability_3}
        the permutation $\pi^{-1}$ is a square and $\rho^{-1}$ is one of
        its square roots.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    All statements~\ref{item:square_stability_1},
    \ref{item:square_stability_2}, and~\ref{item:square_stability_3} are
    direct consequences of Proposition~\ref{prop:endomorphisms}. Indeed,
    since $\pi$ is a square permutation and $\rho$ is a square root of
    $\pi$, by definition $\pi$ appears in the product
    $\rho \SHUFFLE \rho$. Now, by Proposition~\ref{prop:endomorphisms},
    for all $j = 1, 2, 3$, since $\phi_j$ is a morphism of associative
    algebras from $\QQ[S]$ to $\QQ[S]$, $\phi_j$ commutes with the
    shuffle product of permutations $\SHUFFLE$. Hence, in particular,
    one has
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_j(\rho \SHUFFLE \rho) =
        \phi_j(\rho) \SHUFFLE \phi_j(\rho).
    \end{equation}
    Then, since $\pi$ appears in $\rho \SHUFFLE \rho$, $\phi_j(\pi)$
    appears in $\phi_j(\rho) \SHUFFLE \phi_j(\rho)$. This
    implies~\ref{item:square_stability_1}, \ref{item:square_stability_2},
    and~\ref{item:square_stability_3}.
