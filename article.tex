We follow the usual terminology on words~\cite{ChoffrutKarhumaki1997}.
Let us recall here the most important ones. The {\em empty word} is
denoted by $\epsilon$. Let $u$ be a word. We denote by $\widetilde{u}$
the {\em mirror image} of $\pi$. If $P$ is a subset of $[|u|]$, $u_{|P}$
is the subword of $u$ consisting in the letters of $u$ at the positions
specified by the elements of $P$. The {\em shuffle} of two words $u$ and
$v$ is the set recursively defined by
$u \shuffle \epsilon = u = \epsilon \shuffle u$ and
$ua \shuffle vb = (u \shuffle vb)a \cup (ua \shuffle v)b$, were $a$ and
$b$ are letters. A word $u$ is a {\em square} if there exists a word $v$
such that $u$ belongs to $v \shuffle v$.
\medskip

We denote by $S_n$ the set of permutations of size $n$ and by $S$ the
set of all permutations. All permutations are specified by words without
repetition of length $n$ on the alphabet $[n]$, so that all above
definitions about words remain valid on permutations. Let $\pi$ be a
permutation. We denote by $\bar \pi$ (resp. $\pi^{-1}$) the
{\em complementary} (resp. {\em inverse}) of $\pi$. If $u$ is a word of
integers without multiple occurrences of a same letter, $\STD(u)$ is the
{\em standarized} of $u$, that is the unique permutation of the same
size as $u$ such that for all $i, j \in [|u|]$, $u_i < u_j$ if and only
if $\STD(u)_i < \STD(u)_j$. In particular, the image of the map $\STD$
is the set $S$ of all permutations. Two words $u$ and $v$ having the
same standarized are {\em order isomorphic}. If $\sigma$ is a permutation,
there is an {\em occurrence} of (the {\em pattern}) $\sigma$ in $\pi$ if
there is a set $P$ of indexes of letters of $\pi$ such that $\sigma$ and
$\pi_{|P}$ are order isomorphic. When $\pi$ does not admit any occurrence
of $\sigma$, $\pi$ {\em avoids} $\sigma$.

\section{Shuffle product on permutations}
\label{section:Shuffle product on permutations}

The purpose of this section is to define a shuffle product $\SHUFFLE$
on permutations. To define this shuffle product, we shall first define
a coproduct denoted by $\Delta$, enabling to unshuffle permutations.
By duality, $\Delta$ implies the definition of $\SHUFFLE$. The reason
why we need to pass by the definition of $\Delta$ to define $\SHUFFLE$
is justified by the fact that a lot of properties of $\SHUFFLE$ depend
of properties of $\Delta$ and that this strategy allows to write concise
and clear proofs of them. We invite the reader unfamiliar with the
concepts of coproduct and duality to consult~\cite{Joni:Rota:1979}
or~\cite{Grinberg:Reiner:2014}.
\medskip

Let use denote by $\QQ[S]$ the linear span of all permutations. As
announced, we shall define on this space a kind of shuffle product and
for this purpose, we first define a linear coproduct $\Delta$ on $\QQ[S]$.
For any permutation $\pi$, we set
\begin{equation} \label{equ:unshuffling_coproduct}
    \Delta(\pi) =
    \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
    \STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right) \otimes \STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right).
\end{equation}
We call $\Delta$ the {\em unshuffling coproduct of permutations}. For
instance,
\begin{equation}
    \Delta(213) =
    \epsilon \otimes 213 + 2. 1 \otimes 12 +
    1 \otimes 21 + 2. 12 \otimes 1 + 21 \otimes 1 + 213 \otimes \epsilon,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Delta(1234) =
    \epsilon \otimes 1234 + 4. 1 \otimes 123 + 6. 12 \otimes 12 +
    4. 123 \otimes 1 + 1234 \otimes \epsilon,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\begin{split} \label{equ:example_unshuffling_coproduct}
    \Delta(1432) & =
    \epsilon \otimes 1432 + 3. {\bf 1 \otimes 132} + 1 \otimes 321 +
    3. 12 \otimes 21 \\ & + 3. 21 \otimes 12 + 3. 132 \otimes 1 +
    321 \otimes 1 + 1432 \otimes \epsilon.
\end{split}\end{equation}
Observe that the coefficient of the tensor $1 \otimes 132$ is $3$
in~\eqref{equ:example_unshuffling_coproduct} because there are exactly
three ways to extract two disjoint subwords of the permutation $1432$
so that the letters of these two subwords have respectively the same
relative order as the letters of the permutations $1$ and $132$.
\medskip

As any coproduct, $\Delta$ leads to the definition of a product obtained
by duality in the following way. From~\eqref{equ:unshuffling_coproduct},
for any permutation $\pi$, we have
\begin{equation} \label{equ:schematic_coproduct}
    \Delta(\pi) =
    \sum_{\sigma, \nu \in S} \lambda_{\sigma, \nu}^\pi \;
    \sigma \otimes \nu,
\end{equation}
where the $\lambda_{\sigma, \nu}^\pi$ are nonnegative integers. Now,
by definition of duality, the dual product of $\Delta$ denoted by
$\SHUFFLE$ is a linear binary product on $\QQ[S]$. It satisfies, for any
permutations
$\sigma$ and $\nu$,
\begin{equation}
    \sigma \SHUFFLE \nu =
    \sum_{\pi \in S}
    \lambda_{\sigma, \nu}^\pi \; \pi,
\end{equation}
where the coefficients $\lambda_{\sigma, \nu}^\pi$ are the ones
of~\eqref{equ:schematic_coproduct}. We call $\SHUFFLE$ the
{\em shuffle product of permutations}. For instance,
\begin{equation}\begin{split} \label{equ:example_shuffle_product}
    12 \SHUFFLE 21 & =
    1243 + 1324 + 2.1342 + 2.1423 + 3. {\bf 1432} + 2134 + 2.2314 \\
    & + 3.2341 + 2413 + 2.2431 + 2.3124 + 3142 + 3.3214 + 2.3241 \\
    & + 3421 + 3.4123 + 2.4132 + 2.4213 + 4231 + 4312.
\end{split}\end{equation}
Observe that the coefficient $3$ of the permutation $1432$
in~\eqref{equ:example_shuffle_product} comes from the fact that the
coefficient of the tensor $12 \otimes 21$ is $3$
in~\eqref{equ:example_unshuffling_coproduct}.
\medskip

Intuitively, this product shuffles the values and the positions of the
letters of the permutations. There are other shuffle products on
permutations~\cite{DHT:IJAC:2002}: the {\em shifted shuffle} and the
{\em convolution product}. Our shuffle product is different from these
last two.
\medskip

We say that a permutation $\pi$ {\em appears} in the shuffle
$\sigma \SHUFFLE \nu$ of two permutations $\sigma$ and $\nu$ if the
coefficient $\lambda_{\sigma, \nu}^\pi$ defined above is different from
zero. In a more combinatorial way, this is equivalent to say that there
are two sets $P_1$ and $P_2$ of disjoints indexes of letters of $\pi$
satisfying $P_1 \sqcup P_2 = [|\pi|]$ such that the subword $\pi_{|P_1}$
is order isomorphic to $\sigma$ and the subword $\pi_{|P_2}$ is order
isomorphic to $\nu$.
\medskip

Besides, a permutation $\pi$ is a {\em square} if there is a
permutation $\sigma$ such that $\pi$ appears in $\sigma \SHUFFLE \sigma$.
In this case, we say that $\sigma$ is a {\em square root} of $\pi$.
Equivalently, $\pi$ is a square with $\sigma$ as square root if and only
if in the expansion of $\Delta(\pi)$, there is a tensor
$\sigma \otimes \sigma$ with a nonzero coefficient. In a more
combinatorial way, this is equivalent to say that there
are two sets $P_1$ and $P_2$ of disjoints indexes of letters of $\pi$
satisfying $P_1 \sqcup P_2 = [|\pi|]$ such that the subword $\pi_{|P_1}$
and $\pi_{|P_2}$ are order isomorphic.

\section{Binary square words and permutations}
\label{section:Binary square words and permutations}
In this section, we show that the square binary words are in one-to-one
correspondence with some square permutations. This property allows to
obtain a new description of binary square words.
\medskip

Let $u$ be a binary word of length $n$ with $k$ occurrences of $0$.
We denote by $\BINTOPERM$ be the map sending any such word $u$ to the
permutation obtained by replacing from left to right each occurrence of
$0$ in $u$ by $1$, $2$, \dots, $k$, and from right to left each
occurrence of $1$ in $u$ by $k + 1$, $k + 2$, \dots, $n$. For instance,
\begin{equation}
    \BINTOPERM({\bf 1}00{\bf 1}0{\bf 1}{\bf 1}0{\bf 1}000) =
    {\bf C} 12 {\bf B} 3 {\bf A} {\bf 9} 4 {\bf 8} 567.
\end{equation}
Observe that for any nonempty permutation $\pi$ in the image of
$\BINTOPERM$, there is exactly one binary word $u$ such that
$\BINTOPERM(u0) = \BINTOPERM(u1) = \pi$. In support of this observation,
when $\pi$ has an even size, we denote by $\PERMTOBIN(\pi)$ the word $ua$
such that $|ua|_0$ and $|ua|_1$ are both even, where $a \in \{0, 1\}$.
\medskip

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:binary_to_permutation_avoiding}
    The image of the map $\BINTOPERM$ is the set of all permutations
    avoiding the patterns $213$ and $231$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let us first show that the image of $\BINTOPERM$ contains only
    permutation avoiding $213$ and $231$. Let $u$ be a binary word,
    $\pi = \BINTOPERM(u)$, and $P_0$ (resp. $P_1$) be the set of the
    positions of the occurrences of $0$ (resp. $1$) in $u$. By definition
    of $\BINTOPERM$, from left to right, the subword $v = \pi_{|P_0}$ is
    increasing and the subword $w = \pi_{|P_1}$ is decreasing, and all
    letters of $w$ are greater than those of $v$.
    \smallskip

    Now, assume first that $\pi$ admits an occurrence of $213$. Then,
    since $v$ is increasing and $w$ is decreasing, there is an occurrence
    of $3$ (resp. $13$, $23$) in $v$ and a relative occurrence of $21$
    (resp. $2$, $1$). All these three cases contradict the fact that all
    letters of $w$ are greater than those of $v$.
    \smallskip

    Finally, assume that $\pi$ admits an occurrence of $231$. Then,
    for the same reason as in the previous case, there is an occurrence
    of $2$ (resp. $3$, $23$) in $v$ and a relative occurrence of $31$
    (resp. $21$, $1$). All these three cases lead to the same previous
    contradiction.
    \smallskip

    The statement of the lemma follows from the well-known
    fact~\cite{Simion:Schmidt:EJC:1985} that the set of permutations of
    size $n$ avoiding $213$  and $231$ is in one-to-one correspondence
    with the set of binary words of size $n - 1$, and in particular,
    that there is no more such permutations of size $n$ than binary
    words of size $n$.
    \qed
\end{proof}
\medskip

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:square_binary_to_square_permutation}
    If $u$ is a square binary word, then $\BINTOPERM(u)$ is a square
    permutation.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Since $u$ is a square binary word, there is a binary word $v$ such
    that $u \in v \shuffle v$. Then, there are two disjoint sets $P$ and
    $Q$ of positions of letters of $u$ such that $u_{|P} = v = u_{|Q}$.
    Now, by definition of $\BINTOPERM$, the words $\BINTOPERM(u)_{|P}$
    and $\BINTOPERM(u)_{|Q}$ have the same standarized $\rho$. Hence,
    and by definition of the shuffle product of permutations,
    $\BINTOPERM(u)$ appears in $\rho \SHUFFLE \rho$, showing that
    $\BINTOPERM(u)$ is a square permutation.
    \qed
\end{proof}
\medskip

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:square_permutation_to_square_binary}
    If $\pi$ is a square permutation avoiding the patterns $213$ and
    $231$, then $\PERMTOBIN(\pi)$ is a square binary word.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\pi$ be a square permutation avoiding $213$ and $231$. By
    Lemma~\ref{lem:binary_to_permutation_avoiding}, $\pi$ is in the
    image of $\BINTOPERM$ and hence, $u = \PERMTOBIN(\pi)$ is a
    well-defined binary word. Since $\pi$ is a square permutation,
    there are two disjoint sets of indexes $P_1$ and $P_2$ of letters of
    $\pi$ such that $\pi_{|P_1}$ and $\pi_{|P_2}$ are order isomorphic.
    This implies, by the definitions of $\BINTOPERM$ and $\PERMTOBIN$,
    that $u_{|P_1} = u_{|P_2}$, showing that $u$ is a square binary
    word.
    \qed
\end{proof}
\medskip

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:bijection_binary_to_permutations_squares}
    For any $n \geq 0$, the map $\BINTOPERM$ restricted to the set of
    square binary words of length $2n$ is a bijection between this last
    set and the set of square permutations of size $2n$ avoiding the
    patterns $213$ and $231$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Lemmas~\ref{lem:binary_to_permutation_avoiding}
    and~\ref{lem:square_binary_to_square_permutation} show that
    $\BINTOPERM$ is a well-defined mapping associating a square
    permutation of size $2n$ avoiding $213$ and $231$ with any square
    binary word of the same size.
    Besides, Lemma~\ref{lem:square_permutation_to_square_binary}
    implies that $\PERMTOBIN$ is the inverse map of $\BINTOPERM$
    with domain the set of square binary word of length $2n$ and image
    the set of square permutations of size $2n$ avoiding $213$ and $231$.
    \qed
\end{proof}

\section{Algebraic issues}
\label{section:Algebraic issues}
The aim of this section is to establish some of properties of the
shuffle product of permutations $\SHUFFLE$. It is worth to note that, as
we will see, algebraic properties of the unshuffling coproduct $\Delta$
of permutations defined in
Section~\ref{section:Shuffle product on permutations} lead to
combinatorial properties of $\SHUFFLE$.
\medskip

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:shuffle_associative_commutative}
    The shuffle product $\SHUFFLE$ of permutations is associative and
    commutative.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    To prove the associativity of $\SHUFFLE$, it is convenient to show
    that its dual coproduct $\Delta$ is coassociative, that is
    \begin{equation}
        (\Delta \otimes I) \Delta = (I \otimes \Delta) \Delta,
    \end{equation}
    where $I$ denote the identity map. This strategy relies on the fact
    that a product is associative if and only if its dual coproduct is
    coassociative. For any permutation $\pi$, we have
    \begin{equation} \begin{split}
    \label{equ:shuffle_associative_commutative}
        (\Delta \otimes I) \Delta(\pi) & =
        (\Delta \otimes I)
        \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right) \otimes \STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & =
        \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \Delta\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)\right)
        \otimes I\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)\right) \\
        & =
        \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]} \;
        \sum_{Q_1 \uplus Q_2 = [|P_1|]}
        \STD\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)_{|Q_1}\right)
        \otimes
        \STD\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)_{|Q_2}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & =
        \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 \uplus P_3 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right) \otimes
        \STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right) \otimes
        \STD\left(\pi_{|P_3}\right).
    \end{split} \end{equation}
    An analogous computation shows that $(I \otimes \Delta) \Delta(\pi)$
    is equal to the last member
    of~\eqref{equ:shuffle_associative_commutative}, whence the
    associativity of $\SHUFFLE$.
    \smallskip

    Finally, to prove the commutativity of $\SHUFFLE$, we shall show
    that $\Delta$ is cocommutative, that is for any permutation $\pi$,
    if in the expansion of $\Delta(\pi)$ there is a tensor
    $\sigma \otimes \nu$ with a coefficient $\lambda$, there is in the
    same expansion the tensor $\nu \otimes \sigma$ with the same
    coefficient $\lambda$. Clearly, a product is commutative if and only
    if its dual coproduct is cocommutative. Now, from the
    definition~\eqref{equ:unshuffling_coproduct} of $\Delta$, one
    observes that if the pair $(P_1, P_2)$ of subsets of $[|\pi|]$
    contributes to the coefficient of
    $\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right) \otimes \STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)$,
    the pair $(P_2, P_1)$ contributes to the coefficient of
    $\STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right) \otimes \STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)$.
    This shows that $\Delta$ is cocommutative and hence, that $\SHUFFLE$
    is commutative.
    \qed
\end{proof}
\medskip

Proposition~\ref{prop:shuffle_associative_commutative} implies that
$\QQ[S]$ endowed with the unshuffling coproduct $\Delta$ is a
coassociative cocommutative coalgebra, or in an equivalent way, that
$\QQ[S]$ endowed with the shuffle product $\SHUFFLE$ is an associative
commutative algebra.
\medskip

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:endomorphisms}
    The three linear maps
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3 : \QQ[S] \to \QQ[S]
    \end{equation}
    linearly sending a permutation $\pi$ to, respectively,
    $\widetilde{\pi}$, $\bar \pi$, and $\pi^{-1}$ are endomorphims of
    associative algebras.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    To prove, for $j = 1, 2, 3$, that $\phi_j$ is a morphism of
    associative algebras, we have to prove that for all permutations
    $\sigma$ and $\nu$,
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_j(\sigma \SHUFFLE \nu) =
        \phi_j(\sigma) \SHUFFLE \phi_j(\nu).
    \end{equation}
    We shall proceed here as we have done during the proof of
    Proposition~\ref{prop:shuffle_associative_commutative} by showing
    that $\phi_j$ is a morphism of coalgebras, that is
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta \phi_j = (\phi_j \otimes \phi_j) \Delta.
    \end{equation}
    In the sequel, $\pi$ is a permutation.
    \smallskip

    If $P$ is a set of indexes of letters of $\pi$, we denote by
    $\widetilde{P}$ the set $\{|\pi| - i  + 1 : i \in P\}$. Now, since
    the operation $\widetilde{\,}$ define a bijection on the set of the
    subsets of $[|\pi|]$, and since the standardization operation
    commutes with the mirror operation on words, we have
    \begin{equation} \begin{split}
        \Delta(\phi_1(\pi))
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\phi_1(\pi)_{|P_1}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\phi_1(\pi)_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\widetilde{\pi}_{|P_1}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\widetilde{\pi}_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\widetilde{\pi}_{|\widetilde{P_1}}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\widetilde{\pi}_{|\widetilde{P_2}}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \widetilde{\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)}
        \otimes \widetilde{\STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)} \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \phi_1\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)\right)
        \otimes \phi_1\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)\right) \\
        & = (\phi_1 \otimes \phi_1) \Delta(\pi).
    \end{split} \end{equation}
    This shows that $\phi_1$ is a morphism of coalgebras and hence, that
    $\phi_1$ is a morphism of associative algebras.
    \smallskip

    Next, since by definition of the complementation operation on
    permutations, for any permutation $\tau$ and any indexes $i$ and $k$,
    we have $\tau_i < \tau_k$ if and only if $\bar \tau_i > \bar \tau_k$,
    we have
    \begin{equation} \begin{split}
        \Delta(\phi_2(\pi))
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\phi_2(\pi)_{|P_1}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\phi_2(\pi)_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\bar \pi_{|P_1}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\bar \pi_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \phi_2\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)\right)
        \otimes \phi_2\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)\right) \\
        & = (\phi_2 \otimes \phi_2) \Delta(\pi).
    \end{split} \end{equation}
    This shows that $\phi_2$ is a morphism of coalgebras and hence, that
    $\phi_2$ is a morphism of associative algebras.
    \smallskip

    Finally, for any permutation $\tau$, if $P$ is a set of indexes of
    letters of $\tau$, we denote by $P_\tau^{-1}$ the set
    $\{\tau_i : i \in P\}$. Since the map sending a subset $P$ of
    $[|\pi|]$ to $P_\pi^{-1}$ is a bijection, and since
    $\STD\left(\pi_{|P}\right)^{-1} = \STD\left(\pi^{-1}_{|P_\pi^{-1}}\right)$,
    we have
    \begin{equation} \begin{split}
        \Delta(\phi_3(\pi))
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\phi_3(\pi)_{|P_1}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\phi_3(\pi)_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\pi^{-1}_{|P_1}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\pi^{-1}_{|P_2}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\pi^{-1}_{|{P_1}_\pi^{-1}}\right)
        \otimes \STD\left(\pi^{-1}_{|{P_2}_\pi^{-1}}\right) \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)^{-1}
        \otimes \STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)^{-1} \\
        & = \sum_{P_1 \uplus P_2 = [|\pi|]}
        \phi_3\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_1}\right)\right)
        \otimes \phi_3\left(\STD\left(\pi_{|P_2}\right)\right) \\
        & = (\phi_3 \otimes \phi_3) \Delta(\pi).
    \end{split} \end{equation}
    This shows that $\phi_3$ is a morphism of coalgebras and hence, that
    $\phi_3$ is a morphism of associative algebras.

We now use the algebraic properties of $\SHUFFLE$ exhibited by
Proposition~\ref{prop:endomorphisms} to obtain combinatorial properties
of square permutations.
\medskip

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:square_stability}
    Let $\pi$ be a square permutation and $\rho$ be a square root of
    $\pi$. Then,
    \begin{enumerate}[label={\it (\roman*)},fullwidth]
        \item \label{item:square_stability_1}
        the permutation $\widetilde{\pi}$ is a square and
        $\widetilde{\rho}$ is one of its square roots;
        \item \label{item:square_stability_2}
        the permutation $\bar \pi$ is a square and $\bar \rho$ is one of
        its square roots;
        \item \label{item:square_stability_3}
        the permutation $\pi^{-1}$ is a square and $\rho^{-1}$ is one of
        its square roots.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    All statements~\ref{item:square_stability_1},
    \ref{item:square_stability_2}, and~\ref{item:square_stability_3} are
    direct consequences of Proposition~\ref{prop:endomorphisms}. Indeed,
    since $\pi$ is a square permutation and $\rho$ is a square root of
    $\pi$, by definition, $\pi$ appears in the product
    $\rho \SHUFFLE \rho$. Now, by Proposition~\ref{prop:endomorphisms},
    for any $j = 1, 2, 3$, since $\phi_j$ is a morphism of associative
    algebras from $\QQ[S]$ to $\QQ[S]$, $\phi_j$ commutes with the
    shuffle product of permutations $\SHUFFLE$. Hence, in particular,
    one has
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_j(\rho \SHUFFLE \rho) =
        \phi_j(\rho) \SHUFFLE \phi_j(\rho).
    \end{equation}
    Then, since $\pi$ appears in $\rho \SHUFFLE \rho$, $\phi_j(\pi)$
    appears in $\phi_j(\rho \SHUFFLE \rho)$ and also in
    $\phi_j(\rho) \SHUFFLE \phi_j(\rho)$. This shows that
    $\phi_j(\rho)$ is a square root of $\phi_j(\pi)$ and
    implies~\ref{item:square_stability_1}, \ref{item:square_stability_2},
    and~\ref{item:square_stability_3}.
    \qed
\end{proof}
\medskip

Let us say that the {\em class of symmetries} of a permutation $\pi$ is
the closure of the set $\{\pi\}$ by the operations of mirror image,
complementary, and inverse. A consequence of
Proposition~\ref{prop:square_stability} is that the
number of square permutations of a given size $2n$ avoiding a pattern
$\sigma$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of square
permutations of the same size avoiding any permutation of the class
of symmetries of $\sigma$. Besides, an other consequence of
Proposition~\ref{prop:square_stability} is that its makes sense to
enumerate class of symmetries of squares permutations. The sequence
enumerating these begin by

\begin{proposition}
  \label{proposition:hardness}
  Deciding whether a permutation is the union of two
  order-isomorphic patterns is \NPC.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  For the sake of clarity, we will that a bunch of positions $P$
  is \emph{above} (resp. \emph{below}) above another bunch of positions $P'$
  in permutation $\mu$
  if $\mu(x) > \mu(y)$ (resp. $\mu(x) < \mu(y)$) for every $x \in P$
  and every $y \in P'$.
  For exemple, $\nu_1$ is above $\nu_2$ but below $\nu'_1$ in permutation $\mu$.

  \begin{align*}
  N_4 &= 2(2n + k + 2) + 1  = 4n + 2k + 5 \\
  N_3 &= 2(2N_4 + 2n + 2k + 4) + 1 = 20n + 12k + 9 \\
  N_2 &= 2(2N_3 + 2N_4 + 2n + 2k + 4) + 1 \\
  N_1 &= 2(2N_2 + 2N_3 + 2N_4 + 2n + 2k + 4) + 1\text{.}
  \end{align*}
  Notice that $N_1, N_2, N_3$ and $N_4$ are polynomial in $n$.
  The crucial properties are that
  (i) $N_1, N_2, N_3$ and $N_4$ are odd integers
  and
  (ii) $N_i > \left(\sum_{i < j \leq 4} 2N_j\right) + 2n + 2k + k$
  for every $1 \leq i \leq 4$.

  We now turn to defining various gadgets (sequences of integers)
  that act as building blocks in our construction:
  \begin{align*}
  \sigma'  &= ((k+1) \; \sigma \; (k+2)) \; [2N_2 + N_4 + 2n + k + 2] \\
  \pi'     &= ((n+1) \; \pi \; (n+2)) \; [2N_2 + N_4 + n + k + 2] \\
  \sigma'' &= \sigma \; [2N_2 + N_4] \\
  \pi''    &= \pi \; [2N_2 + N_4 + k] \\
  \nu_1    &= \nearrow_{N_1} \; [2N_2 + 2N_3 + 2N_4 + 2n + 2k + 4] \\
  \nu'_1   &= \nearrow_{N_1} \; [N_1 + 2N_2 + 2N_3 + 2N_4 + 2n + 2k + 4] \\
  \nu_2    &= \nearrow_{N_2} \; [N_2] \\
  \nu'_2   &= \searrow_{N_2} \\
  \nu_3    &= \nearrow_{N_3} \; [2N_2 + 2N_4 + 2n + 2k + 4] \\
  \nu'_3   &= \nearrow_{N_3} \; [2N_2 + N_3 + 2N_4 + 2n + 2k + 4] \\
  \nu_4    &= \searrow_{N_4} \; [2N_2 + N_4 + 2n + 2k + 4] \\
  \nu'_4   &= \searrow_{N_4} \; [2N_2]\text{.}
  \end{align*}
  We are now in position to define our target permutation $\mu$:
  $$
  \mu
  =
  \nu_1 \; \nu_2 \; \nu'_1 \; \nu_3 \; \sigma' \; \nu_4 \; \nu'_3 \; \pi' \; \nu'_4 \; \pi'' \; \sigma''
  \text{.}
  $$
  We claim that $\sigma$ occurs as a pattern in $\pi$ if and only if
  there exists a containment-free perfect matching
  $\mathcal{M}$ in $G_\mu$ such that
  for any two disctinct edges
  $(a, b)$ and $(a', b')$ in $\mathcal{M}$
  we have $\mu(a) < \mu(a')$ if and only if $\mu(b) < \mu(b')$.

  Suppose first that $\sigma$ occurs in $\pi$ as a pattern.
  We show how to construct a containment-free perfect matching
  $\mathcal{M}$ in $G_\mu$ such that
  for any two disctinct edges
  $(a, b)$ and $(a', b')$ in $\mathcal{M}$
  we have $\mu(a) < \mu(a')$ if and only if $\mu(b) < \mu(b')$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{M}$ contains $N_1$ pairwise crossing
    $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edges.
    \item $\mathcal{M}$ contains $N_2$ pairwise crossing
    $(\nu_2, \nu'_2)$-edges.
    \item $\mathcal{M}$ contains $N_3$ pairwise crossing
    $(\nu_3, \nu'_3)$-edges.
    \item $\mathcal{M}$ contains $N_4$ pairwise crossing
    $(\nu_4, \nu'_4)$-edges.
    \item $\mathcal{M}$ contains $k+2$ pairwise crossing
    $(\sigma', \pi')$-edges as depicted in Figure~\ref{}.
    (Notice that we use here the fact that $\sigma$ occurs as a pattern in $\pi$).
    \item $\mathcal{M}$ contains $n-k$ pairwise crossing
    $(\pi', \pi'')$-edges as depicted in Figure~\ref{}.
    \item $\mathcal{M}$ contains $k$ pairwise crossing
    $(\pi'', \sigma'')$-edges as depicted in Figure~\ref{}.
    (Notice that we use here again the fact that $\sigma$ occurs as a pattern in $\pi$).
  \end{itemize}
  It can be easily checked (probably referring to Figure~\ref{}) that
  $\mathcal{M}$ is perfect and that
  for any two disctinct edges
  $(a, b)$ and $(a', b')$ in $\mathcal{M}$
  we have $\mu(a) < \mu(a')$ if and only if $\mu(b) < \mu(b')$.

  More precisely,
  (i) the first integer of $\sigma'$
  (\emph{i.e.}, $(k+1) + (2N_2 + N_4 + 2n + k + 2)$) is linked
  to the first integer of $\pi'$
  ((\emph{i.e.}, $(n+1) + (2N_2 + N_4 + n + k + 2)$)),
  (ii)

  (this is possible since ).
  Conversely, suppose that there exists a containment-free perfect matching
  $\mathcal{M}$ in $G_\mu$ such that for any two disctinct edges
  $(a, b)$ and $(a', b')$ in $\mathcal{M}$
  we have $\mu(a) < \mu(a')$ if and only if $\mu(b) < \mu(b')$.
  We show that $\sigma$ occurs as a pattern in $\pi$.
  Whereas the matching $\mathcal{M}$ may not be as regular as in the forward
  direction, the main idea is to prove that $\mathcal{M}$ contains enough structure
  (more precisely, enough $(\sigma', \pi')$-edges) so that we can conclude.
  We have divided the reverse direction into a serie of basic claims that
  progressively defines the overall structure of $\mathcal{M}$.

  \begin{claim}
    \label{claim:no (nu_1, nu_2)-edge}
    There is no $(\nu_1, \nu_2)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}[of Claim~\ref{claim:no (nu_1, nu_2)-edge}]
    We first prove that there exists at most one
    $(\nu_1, \nu_2)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Indeed, suppose, aiming at a contradiction, that there exist
    two $(\nu_1, \nu_2)$-edges $e = (a, b)$ and $e' = (a', b')$ in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Since $\mathcal{M}$ is containment-free,
    we may assume that $a < a'$ and $b < b'$.
    Then it follows that $\mu(a) < \mu(a')$
    (since $\nu_1$ is increasing) and $\mu(b) > \mu(b')$
    (since $\nu_2$ is decreasing),
    which contradicts our hypothesis.

    Suppose now, still aiming at a contradiction, that there exists
    exactly one $(\nu_1, \nu_2)$-edge $e = (a, b)$ in $\mathcal{M}$.
    We show that $\mathcal{M}$ does not contain any $(\nu_1, \nu_1)$-edge.
    Indeed, suppose, aiming at a contradiction,
    that there exists a $(\nu_1, \nu_1)$-edge $(x, y)$ in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Since $\mathcal{M}$ is containment-free,
    we must have $x < a$.
    Then it follows that $\mu(x) < \mu(a)$ (since $\nu_1$ is increasing) and
    $\mu(y) > \mu(b)$ (since $\nu_1$ is above $\nu_2$),
    which contradicts our hypothesis.
    Hence $\mathcal{M}$ does not contain any $(\nu_1, \nu_1)$-edge.
    Furthermore, since $\nu_1$ is increasing and
    there exists only one $(\nu_1, \nu_2)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$,
    we conclude that
    $\mathcal{M}$ contains $N_1-1$ pairwise crossing $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edges.
    But $|\nu_1| = |\nu'_1| = N_1$ and $\mathcal{M}$ is perfect,
    and hence there exists a position, say $y$, in $\nu'_1$ that is
    not involved in a $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
    We rule out this configuration by considering two cases:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Position $y$ is involved in a $(\nu_2, \nu'_1)$-edge,
      say $(x, y)$. Then, we have $\mu(a) > \mu(x)$ (since $\nu_1$ is above $\nu_2$)
      and $\mu(b) < \mu(y)$ (since $\nu_2$ is below $\nu'_1$),
      which contradicts our hypothesis.
      See Fig.~\ref{subfig:no (nu_1, nu_2)-edge - 1}.
      \item Position $y$ is not involved in a $(\nu_2, \nu'_1)$-edge.
      Since $\mathcal{M}$ contains $N_1-1$ pairwise crossing $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edges
      in $\mathcal{M}$ and $|\nu'_1| = N_1$, there exists an edge $(y, z)$ in $\mathcal{M}$
      that is neither a $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edge nor a $(\nu_2, \nu'_1)$-edge
      nor a $(\nu'_1, \nu'_1)$-edge.
      In other words, $z > 2N_1 + N_2$.
      Now, for any $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edge $(x', y')$ in $\mathcal{M}$, we
      have $\mu(x') < \mu(y)$ (since $\nu_1$ is below $\nu'_1$)
      and $\mu(y') > \mu(z)$ (since $\nu'_1$ is above any other gadget),
      which contradicts our hypothesis.
      See Fig.~\ref{subfig:no (nu_1, nu_2)-edge - 2}.
    \end{itemize}
    \qed
  \end{proof}



  \begin{claim}
    \label{claim:one (nu_1, nu'_1)-edge}
    There is at least one $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}[of Claim~\ref{claim:one (nu_1, nu'_1)-edge}]
    Suppose, aiming at a contradiction, that there is no
    $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Then it follows that there exists an edge $(x, y)$ in $\mathcal{M}$,
    $1 \leq x \leq N_1$, that is neither a
    $(\nu_1, \nu_1)$-edge (since $N_1$ is odd)
    nor a $(\nu_1, \nu_2)$-edge (Claim~\ref{claim:no (nu_1, nu_2)-edge})
    nor a $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$ (by our contradiction hypothesis).
    (In other words, $x \leq N_1$ and $y > 2N_1 + N_2$.)
    Therefore, since $\mathcal{M}$ is containment-free,
    there is neither a $(\nu_2, \nu_2)$-edge nor a $(\nu'_1, \nu'_1)$-edge
    in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Then it follows that every position $x$ of $\nu'_1$
    (\emph{i.e.}, $N_1+N_2 < x \leq 2N_1+N_2$)
    is involved in an edge $(x, y)$ of $\mathcal{M}$ with $y \geq 2N_1+N_2$.
    But $|\nu'_1| = N_1 = 2(2N_2 + 2n_3 + 2N_4 + 2n + 2k + 4) + 1
    > 2N_2 + 2N_3 + 2N_4 + 2n + 2k + 4$, and hence at least one
    position in $\nu'_1$ can not be involved in an edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Then it follows that $\mathcal{M}$ is not a perfect matching,
    which contradicts our hypothesis.
    \qed

  \begin{claim}
    \label{claim:no (nu_2, nu_2)-edge}

  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}[of Claim~\ref{claim:no (nu_2, nu_2)-edge}]
  Combine the fact that $\mathcal{M}$ is containment-free with
  Claim~\ref{claim:one (nu_1, nu'_1)-edge}.
  \qed
  \end{proof}

  \begin{claim}
    \label{claim:no (nu_2, nu'_1)-edge}
    There is no $(\nu_2, \nu'_1)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}[of Claim~\ref{claim:no (nu_2, nu'_1)-edge}]
    We first prove that there exists at most one
    $(\nu_2, \nu'_1)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Indeed, suppose, aiming at a contradiction, that there exist
    two $(\nu_2, \nu'_1)$-edges $e = (a, b)$ and $e' = (a', b')$ in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Since $\mathcal{M}$ is containment-free,
    we may assume that $a < a'$ and $b < b'$.
    Then it follows that $\mu(a) > \mu(a')$
    (since $\nu_2$ is decreasing) and $\mu(b) < \mu(b')$
    (since $\nu'_1$ is increasing),
    which contradicts our hypothesis.

    Suppose now, still aiming at a contradiction, that there exists
    exactly one $(\nu_2, \nu'_1)$-edge $e = (a, b)$ in $\mathcal{M}$.
    According to Claim~\ref{claim:one (nu_1, nu'_1)-edge}, there exists at least
    one $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Furtheremore, since
    there is no $(\nu_1, \nu_2)$-edge (Claim~\ref{claim:no (nu_1, nu_2)-edge}),
    every position in $\nu_1$ is involved either in a
    $(\nu_1, \nu_1)$-edge or in a $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$
    (otherwise $\mathcal{M}$ would not be containment-free).
    Then it follows that that there is an odd number of $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edges
    in $\mathcal{M}$ since $\mathcal{M}$ is perfect and $|\nu_1| = N_1$ is odd.
    Combining this with the fact that there exists exactly one $(\nu_2, \nu'_1)$-edge
    in $\mathcal{M}$ and $|\nu'_1| = N_1$ is odd,
    we conclude that there exists a position, say $x$, in $\nu'_1$
    that is neither involved in a $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edge nor a $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edge
    nor a $(\nu'_1, \nu'_1)$-edge.
    Write $(x, y)$, $N_1+N_2 < x \leq 2N_1 + N_2$ and $y > 2N_1 + N_2$, this edge.
    We have $\mu(a) < \mu(x)$ (since $\nu_2$ is below $\nu'_1$)
    and $\mu(b) > \mu(y)$ (since $\nu'_1$ is above any other gadget),
    which contradicts our hypothesis.
    \qed

    \label{claim:one (nu_2, nu'_2)-edge}
    There is at least one $(\nu_2, \nu'_2)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}[of Claim~\ref{claim:one (nu_2, nu'_2)-edge}]
    Suppose, aiming at a contradiction there there is no
    $(\nu_2, \nu'_2)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Notice that there is no
    $(\nu_1, \nu_2)$-edge (Claim~\ref{claim:no (nu_1, nu_2)-edge})
    nor $(\nu_2, \nu_2)$-edge (Claim~\ref{claim:no (nu_2, nu_2)-edge})
    nor $(\nu_2, \nu'_1)$-edge (Claim~\ref{claim:no (nu_2, nu'_1)-edge})
    in $\mathcal{M}$.
    But $|\nu_2| = N_2 > 2N_3 + 2N_4 + 2n + 2k$ and hence $\mathcal{M}$ is not
    a perfect matching.
    According to Proposition~\ref{proposition:matching}, this is
    a contradiction.

    \label{claim:no (nu'_1, nu'_1),(nu_3, nu_3),(sigma' ,sigma'),(nu_4, nu_4)-edge}
    There is
    no $(\nu'_1, \nu'_1)$-edge,
    no $(\nu_3, \nu_3)$-edge,
    no $(\sigma', \sigma')$-edge and
    no $(\nu_4, \nu_4)$-edge
    in $\mathcal{M}$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}[of Claim~\ref{claim:no (nu'_1, nu'_1),(nu_3, nu_3),(sigma' ,sigma'),(nu_4, nu_4)-edge}]
    Combine Claim~\ref{claim:one (nu_2, nu'_2)-edge} with the fact that
    $\mathcal{M}$ is containment-free (Proposition~\ref{proposition:matching}).
    \qed
  \end{proof}

  \begin{claim}
    \label{claim:no (nu_3, nu'_2)-edge}
    There is no $(\nu_3, \nu'_2)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}[of Claim~\ref{claim:no (nu_3, nu'_2)-edge}]
    Suppose, aiming at a contradiction, that there exists
    $(\nu_3, \nu'_2)$-edge $(a, b)$ in $\mathcal{M}$.
    According to Claim~\ref{claim:one (nu_2, nu'_2)-edge}, there
    exists at least one $(\nu_2, \nu'_2)$-edge $(x, y)$ in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Since $\mathcal{M}$ is containment-free (Proposition~\ref{proposition:matching}),
    we have $y < b$.
    Therefore,
    we have $\mu(x) < \mu(a)$ (by construction) and
    $\mu(y) > \mu(b)$ (since $\nu'_2$ is decreasing).
    According to Proposition~\ref{proposition:matching}, this is
    a contradiction.
    \qed
  \end{proof}

  \begin{claim}
    \label{claim:no (nu_1, nu_3)-edge no (nu'_1, nu_3)-edge}
    There is neither $(\nu_1, \nu'_3)$-edge nor $(\nu'_1, \nu_3)$-edge
    in $\mathcal{M}$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}[of Claim~\ref{claim:no (nu_1, nu_3)-edge no (nu'_1, nu_3)-edge}]
    Suppose, aiming at a contradiction, that there exists a
    $(\nu_1, \nu'_3)$-edge $(a, b)$ in $\mathcal{M}$.
    According to Claim~\ref{claim:one (nu_1, nu'_1)-edge} there exists
    $(\nu_1, \nu'_1)$-edge $(x, y)$ in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Since these two edges have to be crossing
    (Proposition~\ref{proposition:matching}), we have $x < a$.
    Therefore, we have
    $\mu(x) < \mu(a)$ (since $\nu_1$ is increasing)
    and
    $\mu(y) > \mu(b)$ (by construction).
    According to Proposition~\ref{proposition:matching}, this is
    a contradiction.

    A similar argument shows that there is no
    $(\nu'_1, \nu_3)$-edge in $\mathcal{M}$.
    \qed
  \end{proof}

  \begin{claim}
    \label{claim:at most one (nu_2, nu_3)-edge}
    There is at most one $(\nu_2, \nu_3)$-edge
    in $\mathcal{M}$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}[of Claim~\ref{claim:at most one (nu_2, nu_3)-edge}]
    Suppose, aiming at a contradiction, that there exist two
    $(\nu_2, \nu_3)$-edges $(a, b)$ and $(a', b')$ in $\mathcal{M}$.
    Since these two edges have to be crossing
    (Proposition~\ref{proposition:matching}), we may assume that
    $a < a'$ and $b < b'$.
    Therefore, we have
    $\mu(a) > \mu(a')$ (since $\nu_2$ is decreasing)
    and
    $\mu(b) < \mu(b')$ (since $\nu_3$ is increasing).
    According to Proposition~\ref{proposition:matching}, this is
    a contradiction.

\begin{proposition}
  \label{proposition:patterns:lower bound}
  Let $\pi \in S_{n}$.
  Then $\pi$ contains a pattern of size at least
  $\left\lfloor\sqrt{n-1}/2\right\rfloor$ that
  is the union of two order-isomorphic patterns.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[of Proposition~\ref{proposition:patterns:lower bound}]
  The Erd√∂s-Szekeres theorem \cite{Erdos:Szekeres:1935}
  states that every permutation of
  length at least $pq+1$ must contain either the pattern
  $\nearrow_{p+1}$ or the pattern $\searrow_{q+1}$.
  The result now follows from the fact that
  the pattern $\nearrow_{p+1}$ (resp. $\searrow_{q+1}$)
\qed
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  \label{proposition:patterns:upper bound}
  If $2^{\binom{k}{2}} > \binom{n}{2k}\;\binom{2k}{k}$, then there exists
  a permutation of $S_{n}$
  that does not contains a pattern
  of length $2k$ that is the union of two
  order-isomorphic patterns.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[of Proposition~\ref{proposition:patterns:upper bound}]
The proof is by the probabilistic method \cite{Alon:Spencer:1992}.
Let $\pi \in S_n$ be chosen randomly and uniformly.
For any pattern $\sigma$ of length $2k$ ($k$ to be precisely defined latter)
of $\pi$,
let $X_\sigma$ be the indicator variable that
$\sigma$ is the union of two order-ismorphic patterns.
According to Boole's inequality, we have
$P\left(X_\sigma\right) \leq \binom{2k}{k}\;2^{-k}$.
Since there are $\binom{n}{2k}$ patterns of length $2k$ in $\pi$,
the probability that $\pi$ contains a pattern of length $2k$
is the union of two order-ismorphic patterns is at most
$\binom{n}{2k}\;\binom{2k}{k}\;2^{-k} < 1$.
Thus, with positive probability, no event $X_\sigma$ occurs and
there is a permutation of $S_n$ that does not contain a pattern
of length $2k$ that is the union of two order-isomorphic patterns.
\qed
\end{proof}
